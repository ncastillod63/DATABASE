# API Library + Interface

This project is an application for:
- Managing clients of the Expertsof company (CRUD).
- Populating the database with a manually formatted CSV file.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

You must have installed:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher) → https://nodejs.org
2. A database manager (example: MySQL)

---

## ⚙️ Installation and Configuration
In the project folder, run the following command to install the nodejs dependencies.

**npm install**

This will install:
express → Backend Framework

mysql2 → MySQL Connection

nodemon → Automatically restart the development server.

Then we can start the server with the following command:
**npm start**

To access the frontend, go to **http://localhost:3000**

Importing the CSV files into the database still needs to be done separately with the SQL scripts, which are in another project folder.

The server is statically configured on port 3000 and can be modified from the server.js file.

This project implements a relational database in MySQL to manage customers, payment platforms, invoices, and financial transactions.
The system allows administrators, financial managers, and analysts to track revenue, outstanding invoices, and transactions by platform.

🔗 Relationships

One client → can have multiple bills and transactions.

One bill → belongs to one client but can have multiple related transactions.

One platform → can process many transactions.

One transaction → belongs to exactly one client, one bill, and one platform.

📊 Example Queries

1. Total amount paid per client

SELECT 
    c.id_client,
    c.name_client,
    SUM(t.amount_transaction) AS total_paid
FROM clients c
JOIN transactions t ON c.id_client = t.id_client
WHERE t.estatus_transaction = 'Completada'
GROUP BY c.id_client, c.name_client
ORDER BY total_paid DESC;


---

2. Pending bills with client and transaction details

SELECT 
    b.id_bill,
    b.period,
    b.invoiced_amount,
    b.paid_amount,
    (b.invoiced_amount - b.paid_amount) AS outstanding_balance,
    c.name_client,
    t.id_transaction,
    t.date_transaction,
    t.amount_transaction,
    t.estatus_transaction
FROM bills b
JOIN clients c ON b.id_client = c.id_client
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON b.id_bill = t.id_bill
WHERE b.paid_amount < b.invoiced_amount
ORDER BY outstanding_balance DESC;
